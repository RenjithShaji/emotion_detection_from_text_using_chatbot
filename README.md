## Overview

Emotion detection from text is a crucial task in natural language processing, with applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, and virtual assistant interactions. This project explores the implementation of a chatbot-based emotion detection system, which involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for model training.
- **Model Building**: Building a neural network model for emotion detection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

The notebook provides detailed explanations and code comments to guide you through each step of the process.

## Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset containing text samples labeled with corresponding emotions. While the dataset used in the demonstration is not included in this repository, you can find similar datasets online or use your own data for experimentation.
